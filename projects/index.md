## AnimatedCluster Strategy

Working with vector data, many times we need to render a big number of points. In this situations the Cluster strategy is really helpful allowing to group point and avoiding collisions or overlapping.
 The AnimatedCluster strategy is an improvement of the original Cluster, allowing to animate the clusters when the user changes the zoom level.

## Stickies

Storing sticky notes on your machine with HTML5 and IndexedDBStickies was developed to have my custom sticky board where to place my notes. Similarly to SimplyWrite it makes use of IndexedDB capabilities so all the notes are stored in your local machine instead on a server. [Read more](http://acuriousanimal.com/blog/2011/08/12/local-storage-storing-sticky-notes-on-your-machine-with-html5/)...

## Brief introduction to Dojo Widgets creation

Dojo Toolkit is a great JavaScript framework. It is has a powerful and homogeneous API and offers a rich set of visual components (so called widgets, like buttons, tabs, grids, trees, ...) that makes it perfect to build RIA (_Rich Internet Applications_).

One of the key features of the Dojo is the possibility to create new widgets to simplify the development of complex applications. This is a introductory presentation to the custom widgets development.
