Finally I completed most of the chapters I had thought for the book. Although two chapters remains to be written, I think the current content is extensive enough to help anybody interested to lean this great new version of the OpenLayers project.

The current chapters explains:
 - The map and the view
 - Layers
 - Data sources and formats
 - Vector layers
 - Events, listeners and properties

The two remaining chapters I have in mind are:
 - Controls and interaction
 - Overlays

Hope, this book help you to introduce to the OpenLayers version 3.

Remember, thanks to the LeanPub platform, when you buy the book you can get any later update I make on it. In addition, you have 45 days for refund if you think the book does not cover your expectations. In addition, don't hesitate to contact me for any errors, misspelled words or sentences, etc.

Remember, this is a self-published book. No main company is behind it and no great marketing campaign is prepared. Any help from you, talking about the book at any forum or social network will be appreciated.

Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Pilar, for her understanding and almost infinite patience for my job, hobby and profession, the computer science.
