<p>After some time as a pending task, finally I have  created a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github </a>account to share code and any other things with you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://github.com/acanimal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-257" title="github" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/uploads/github.png" alt="" width="342" height="339" /></a></p>

<p>I'm feel lucky because from time to time some people write me asking about code they found in some of my old blogs (many often about the dicontinued <a href="http://theballoonproject.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">theballoonproject</a> blog).</p>
<p>Long time ago I used Google Pages to store my zipped code but google discontinued the project. Some people looking for WWJ info found the blog but can't download the code and they request to me.</p>
<p>Now using github you are free to download that code, and any other I publish from time to time.</p>
<p>Of course, feel free to contact with me for any help or suggestions you have.</p>
