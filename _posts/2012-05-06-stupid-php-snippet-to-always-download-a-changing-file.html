<p>It is short, it is easy, it is stupid but... can save you time.</p>
<p>If you need to download every few minutes a remote file that changes its contents at regular intervals of time this is for you.</p>

<p>Save this on a <code>stupid.php</code> file (and change the values):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&lt;?php
$url = 'somewhere_in_the_space';
while(true) {
	$locaFile = "some_local_file_name_".time()."_with_extension";
	file_put_contents($locaFile, file_get_contents($url));
	echo "Done... $locaFile \n";
	sleep(60*5);    // Sleep 5 minutes !!!
}
?&gt;</pre>
<p>and execute with:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">&gt; php -f stupid.php</pre>
<p>Remember it will run forever until you kill the process so don't expect to finish.</p>
