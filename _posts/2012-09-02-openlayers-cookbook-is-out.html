<p>I'm proud to announce it. My first work as author of a technical book sees the light. After some months of work (really hard work combined with my day to day job), finally the book is out:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}assets/uploads/7843OS_OpenLayer%20Cookbook_cov_0.jpg" alt="OpenLayers Cookbook" width="125" height="151" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">NOTE: You can read the first chapter <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/sites/default/files/9781849517843-Chapter-01.pdf?utm_source=packtpub&amp;utm_medium=free&amp;utm_campaign=pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The book is a practical book written in a cookbook style. I tried to find and describe the common recipes anybody can use or can need in a day to day work. Of course, the OpenLayers library and JavaScript language are great enough to be described in a single book.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The recipes level goes from beginner to intermediate users with some touches for advanced users.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Writing a book can be done by a single man, but the proces to publish one is enough complex to be made by a single person.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are lot of persons I need to thank. To the people at <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book" target="_blank">Packt Publishing</a>: <em>Usha Iyer</em>, <em>Kedar Bhat</em>, <em>Joel Goveya</em>, <em>Joyslita Dsouza</em> and <em>Madhuri Das</em> (sorry if I miss someone). To my awesome reviewers: <em>David Burgoon</em>, <em>Mohammad Motamedi</em> (thanks Mohammad for your great review), <em>Jorge Sanz</em>, <em>Srinivas Shanmugam</em>, <em>Davor Zelic</em> and <em>Richard Zijlstra</em>. To my own folks who always encourage me and, of course, to my wife who suffers my addiction to computer science. Thanks to all this work has been possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Finally, thanks to all the readers of the book. I hope the book was what they expect from it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">No doubt to write here asking for help. Thanks to all !!!</p>
