<p>Suppose you are working on a nice web application where the user can upload images to, for example, a shop catalogue (mmm... that makes me think on something :p ) but wait... you don't the catalogue uses the whole image you upload instead a piece of it. So, we need to crop the image.</p>

<p><a href="http://acuriousanimal.com/code/jcrop_html5canvas/" rel="http://acuriousanimal.com/code/jcrop_html5canvas/"
  target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-389 " title="jcrop" src="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/uploads/jcrop.png"
  alt="" width="863" height="630" /></a></p>
<p>I won't go in depth on how to create the whole process, in summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>User choose an images and app upload to server.</li>
<li>Wep app shows the images to user and allows him/her to crop the desired piece of image.</li>
<li>Crop parameters (x, y, widht, height) are sent to server which responsible to really crop the image.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we talk about the step 2: the web page that allows to crop (or choose some image area) and send the parameters to the serve to make the real crop (for example using GD or ImageMagick).</p>
<p>The real magic comes from <a href="http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html" target="_blank">JCrop</a>, a jQuery plugin to select areas within an image. As I note in the demo, in the JCrop project page there is a demo that makes a preview of the selection using two &lt;img&gt; elements.</p>
<p>Here the we are going to make something very similar but using the HTML5 canvas element (to practice a bit :p).</p>
<p>The first step is to add one img element pointing to the image and one canvas element which will act as the previous:</p>
<pre class="brush:xml">&lt;img src="./sago.jpg" id="target" alt="Flowers" /&gt;
&lt;canvas id="preview" style="width:150px;height:150px;overflow:hidden;"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
<p>Now the code that preview the selected cropped image every time the user updates the selected area:</p>
<pre class="brush:js">$('#target').Jcrop({
	onChange : updatePreview,
	onSelect : updatePreview,
	aspectRatio : 1
});

function updatePreview(c) {
	if(parseInt(c.w) &gt; 0) {
		// Show image preview
		var imageObj = $("#target")[0];
		var canvas = $("#preview")[0];
		var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
		context.drawImage(imageObj, c.x, c.y, c.w, c.h, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
	}
};</pre>
<p>As you can see the main parameters are the coordinate fields (variable 'c'). One way to send it to server is to store in four hidden input filed in a form, and send them on submit.</p>
<p>Looking again to the post I think there are too much words to simply show an easy HTML5 canvas example :)</p>
