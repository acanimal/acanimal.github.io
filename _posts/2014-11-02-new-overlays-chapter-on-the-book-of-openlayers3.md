[The Book of OpenLayers 3](https://leanpub.com/thebookofopenlayers3) has been updated !!!

> This book is self-published, no great editorial is behind it neither a marketing campaign, so I appreciate any shares you can make through social networks and any other media.

What you can find in this new update?

* **A new _Overlays_ chapter**. This is a short but necessary chapter that explains how we can work with overlays to place any kind of HTML located within the map. As I comment, it is a short chapter but I prefer to leave it as an independent chapter.
* **A new sample** on the _Events, listeners and properties_ chapter, named _Styling features under the pointer_. Once we know about feature styling and events, the sample demonstrates how we can change the style of the features under the pointer.

The book has now 6 chapters and is 80% complete. Currently I continue working on a more extensive chapter called **_Controls and Interactions_**, which I hope to have finished in approximately a month.

Please, don't hesitate to contact me with comments and suggestions. Your feedback is really valuable for me.

Thanks for your confidence in [The Book of OpenLayers 3](https://leanpub.com/thebookofopenlayers3).
