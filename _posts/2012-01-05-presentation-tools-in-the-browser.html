<p>With the arrival of HTML5+CSS3 the browsers are getting more attention because the new possibilities.</p>
<p>One example of the possibilities are the proliferation of frameworks, tools and libraries to create HTML presentations to run in the browser. No need to transform your presentation from PowerPoint or Keynote to any portable format, the content is plain HTML.</p>

<h2>First contact</h2>
<p>The first tool of this kind I listened was the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/html5slides">html5slides</a> project. You can see it in action <a href="http://html5slides.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/template/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some time later, I read a new about a new tool called <a href="http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js">deck.js</a>. I think it is awesome, extensible and... see for yourself at the <a href="http://imakewebthings.github.com/deck.js/introduction">Getting Started</a> section.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago I read a tweet talking about <a href="http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js">impress.js</a>. For the moment it is only compatible with Chrome and Safari (both uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit">WebKit</a> engine) but is looks really impressive.</p>
<h3>Many more</h3>
<p>Knowing the previous projects I start looking for other alternatives I <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2533908/basic-framework-for-presentations-using-html5-javascript">found</a> a great range of projects: <a href="http://adamzap.com/random/landslide.html">Landslide</a>, <a href="http://www.ravelrumba.com/blog/html5-slideshow">html5-slideshow</a> (see a demo <a href="http://www.ravelrumba.com/code/demos/html-slideshow/example/slideshow.html">here</a>), <a href="https://github.com/chromakode/pow">pow</a> (see in action <a href="http://usepow.com">here</a>) or <a href="https://github.com/paulrouget/dzslides">DZSlides</a>, a <em>one-page-template</em> to build your presentation in HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
<p>Within this <a href="http://smsteele.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/maremagnum-word-of-the-day/">maremagnum</a> of possibilities the confusion is assured: which tool is better? which is easy to use? which has more effects? which one is more flexible and/or extensible? which want has more followers and/or supporters? which one will survive in the future?</p>
<h2>Â The future</h2>
<p>Currently, all these tools are great but they all are oriented to a web developer user with strong knowledge on HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>The next step is clear, adapt to <em>plain</em> users (a user without web technologies knowledge). The tools needs an editor to help in the creation of the slides, like PowerPoint or Keynote.</p>
<p>There are projects working on this direction, like the <a href="http://www.280slides.com/">280Slides</a>. It is implemented in <a href="http://cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a> framework and brings the user a Keynote like editor to visually create the slides.</p>
<h2>More history</h2>
