<p>Create a map of the earth isn't an easy problem. Projections basically tries to solve the problem of how to 3D element on a 2D surface.</p>

<p>Tons of papers have been written about this problem but a nice place to start is the wikipedia entry about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection">Map Projections</a>.</p>

<p>Some time ago I seen a awesome video from the project <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/myriahedral/">Unfolding the Earth: Myriahedral Projections</a>. On it, the author divides the sphere into a myriahedron (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron">polyhedron</a> with a very large number of faces) which allows to unfold the sphere in many different map projections.</p>

<p>Recently I could seen another nice experiment at the <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/">bl.ocks.org</a> site. The <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/3711652">Projection Transitions</a> is an great map work example implemented with <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> library which shows an animated transition of map projections.</p>

<p>Don't you think D3 is becoming a great project? I think I need to get some time to spend on it.</p>
