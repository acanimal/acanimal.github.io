<p>I was thinking on it for a long time, but due a lack of free time I never started. Finally I can officially say I have start writing <em>The book of OpenLayers3</em>.</p>

<p>More probably it will be a hard task, because OpenLayers3 is still in heavy development process and currently it is in beta status. But... no one said it will be easy.</p>
<p>OpenLayers3 is a completely rewritten version with the goal to create an up to date library, mobile ready out of the box and making use of the current best technologies.</p>
<p>My previous experience writing the <a title="OpenLayers Cookbook" href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openlayers-cookbook">OpenLayers Cookbook</a> for <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book">Packt Publishing</a><b> </b>was really great and, after declining an offer to rewrite it for the OpenLayer3 version, I was thinking on the possibility to write a new book.</p>
<p>Although the experience was good, I found the cookbook format a bit restrictive in the way I could write. It is a cookbook so it is oriented to explain concrete situations with a concrete format, and that was the problem for me.</p>
<p>When I write I like to do it taking the role of a person that must teach to another one with less knowledge. I like to situate the reader and explain why things are how they are, and that requires more prose than it could be written in a cookbook.</p>
<p>I don't want to be formal. I don't want to follow any book conventions, I simply want to write in a way I think is natural to learn, in the order I consider is more logic to understand the tool.</p>
<p>Because of this, I finally chose to write the book by myself. It is on its early stage but it would be a mix between a beginners book and a cookbook, accompanied with a set of code examples. It is the XXI century so my intention is to offer it as an ebook. I'm not sure which platform to use (maybe <a href="https://leanpub.com/">LeanPub</a>) neither the price for it.</p>
<p>So this is the time to help me suggesting me things to explain, examples to add, etc.</p>
