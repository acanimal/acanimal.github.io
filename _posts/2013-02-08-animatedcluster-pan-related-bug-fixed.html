<p>If you regularly follow this blog and are web mapping developer that works with OpenLayers, (too much coincidences???) probably you know about the the <a title="Animated marker cluster strategy for OpenLayers" href="http://acuriousanimal.com/blog/2012/08/19/animated-marker-cluster-strategy-for-openlayers/" target="_blank">Animated marker cluster strategy for OpenLayers</a> I created some time ago.</p>

<p>Unfortunally, the last version (v0.2) has a ugly <a href="https://github.com/acanimal/AnimatedCluster/issues/2" target="_blank">bug</a>. The code works fine when you change the zoom level but clusters are not updated when you pan the map.</p>
<p>I'm happy to say right now I have uploaded a new version (v0.3) which fixes this bug on my <a href="https://github.com/acanimal/AnimatedCluster" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>. Basically, now the code controls if the action is a zoom change or a pan movement and updates and animates the clusters accordingly. That is, if you pan the map the clusters on the current level are recomputed.</p>
<p><strong>Take into account this can cause the features where clustered in different clusters</strong>, so you can see how bubbles changes its position and number of features within it.</p>
<p>In addition, the demo page has been updated with the new version. Check it !!!</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanks to all the great people that has sent me their experiences when using the AnimatedCluster !!!</p></blockquote>
