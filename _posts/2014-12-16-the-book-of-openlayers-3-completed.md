It was a long road but finally it comes true: The Book of OpenLayers 3 is finished.

[![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}assets/uploads/thebookofopenlayers3-230x300.jpeg)](https://leanpub.com/thebookofopenlayers3)

The chapter _Controls and Interactions_Â concludes the exploration of the main concepts related with OpenLayers version 3\. This chapter is focused on showing how to work with the two main tools necessary to interact with the maps and its contents.

New samples have been created. Remember the source code can be found at [https://github.com/acanimal/thebookofopenlayers3](https://github.com/acanimal/thebookofopenlayers3) and a running demo is available at [http://acanimal.github.io/thebookofopenlayers3/](http://acanimal.github.io/thebookofopenlayers3/).

I must admit _finished_ is not the best word to apply, OpenLayers3 is big, complex and awesome enough to write tons of chapters, but I must put a final dot and leave the typewriter... for a while :)

Some of you have contact to me notifying spelling errors. I have given priority to the release of the final chapter.

Please don't hesitate to contact me to notify me more error (or anything), my next release will be a maintenance version fixing all that errors.

Many of you has suggested me many ideas on features to write about, so I think I will come back with a "There is more" really final chapter some day.

Thanks for your confidence.
