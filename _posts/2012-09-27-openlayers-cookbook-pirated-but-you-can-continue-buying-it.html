<p>Approximately a month ago my book <a title="OpenLayers Cookbook is out !!!" href="http://acuriousanimal.com/blog/2012/09/02/openlayers-cookbook-is-out/" target="_blank">OpenLayers Cookbook</a> was released by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book" target="_blank">PacktPublishing</a>Â and today I found it is available at many sites <del>of debatable reputation</del>.</p>
<p>Really I'm surprising by the velocity of this alternative publication process :)</p>

<a href="http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book">
<img class="alignleft" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}assets/uploads/7843OS_OpenLayer%20Cookbook_cov_0.jpg" alt=""

<p>Honestly, I hope all these sites have many downloads, that means the book is interesting for many people.</p>
<p>Hopefully, for all of you that are contrary to piracy the book continues available at legal sites ready to be bought for a few dollars</p>
