<p>In the past, I have been using <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Dojo Toolkit</a> for relatively little projects. I choose Dojo by its well designed API and its rich and homogeneous set of widgets.jQuery and jQueryUI are great projects, but I found the problem of consistency with jQuery plugins. Each one follow its own rules, each one has its documentation and API, etc.</p>

<p>Because of this, once I know Dojo I chose it as my preferred framework for RIA applications.</p>
<p>Here I would like to present you a short introduction on how to create widgets in Dojo. It is a simply summary of things relate to the widgets creation, it is not a step by step tutorial or code sample:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://acuriousanimal.com/code/dojo_brief_intro_presentation"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-655" title="dojo_intro" alt="" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}assets/uploads/dojo_intro.png" width="632" height="495" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The presentation is built using the <a href="http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js" target="_blank">impress.js</a> tool, so I recommend to visualize it using Chrome browser. You can use a recent version of FireFox too, but I see Chrome is the one which make smoothest visualization.</p>
