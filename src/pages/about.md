He is a firm believer of agile methodologies (and much more about common sense). There is no ring to rule them all, every place needs to forge its own master ring.

He is mainly experienced in the Java and JavaScript ecosystems (Spring, Hibernate, JPA, NodeJS, Express, React, Redux, ...) but also has some knowledge about other programming languages in addition to devops.

This is what he says:

> I'm a passionate programmer and a acceptableÂ guitar player

and this is what job mates says:

> He's incredibly motivated and an awesome developer but as guitar player he must improve a lot his skills.
