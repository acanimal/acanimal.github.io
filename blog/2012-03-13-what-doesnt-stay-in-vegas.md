Today, and thanks to a colleague, I found this great video about how the Las Vegas city has grown in the past years.

> When Landsat 5 launched on March 1, 1972, Las Vegas was a smaller city. This image series, done in honor of the satellite's 28th birthday, shows the desert city's massive growth spurt since 1972. The outward expansion of the city is shown in a false-color time lapse of data from all the Landsat satellites.

<p>In addition to the video, what takes special attention to me was the two most rated comments:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Humans are like a virus on this planet...</em></li>
<li><em>Remove the tumor</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Are we going on the right way?</p>
