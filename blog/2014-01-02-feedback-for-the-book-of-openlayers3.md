Finally I have decided to use <a href="https://leanpub.com/">LeanPub</a> as the platform to publish my book. Here you can see the public page with a description about it: <a href="https://leanpub.com/thebookofopenlayers3">The book of OpenLayers3</a>. Hope within a couple of weeks I can publish a sample chapter.

<h3> What do I need from you?</h3>
<p>What I need right now are your feedback, your opinions and reviews.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think about the book description?</li>
<li>Do you like the cover image?</li>
<li>How much would you be willing to pay for it?</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>I need you to be critical with mine to make a good job.</p>
<p>Thanks !!!</p>
