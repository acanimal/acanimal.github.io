<p>I have tested many source code editors and IDEs and I can confirm it continues being my preferred editor for web development. Which is it? Continue reading please.</p>
<p>In my day to day I work with different operating systems. I have Windows at work, Ubuntu at home and MacOSX on my laptop, so one of the points I consider very important is the multi-platform capability.</p>
<p>I have tested applications, in the three OS, that goes from simple source code editors to complete IDEs.</p>
<p>Notepad++<br />
Ultraedit</p>
<p>Eclipse<br />
NetBeans<br />
aptana<br />
Komodo Edit</p>
