Geographic coordinate systems uses latitude and longitude as angles measured from the earthâ€™s centre. A geographic coordinate system is substantially defined by the ellipsoid used to model the earth, and the position of the ellipsoid positioned relatively to the centre of the earth (called Datum).

A projected coordinate system is defined on a flat two-dimensional surface. A projected coordinate system is always based on a geographic coordinate system, hence it uses an ellipsoid and a Datum. Besides projected coordinate systems includes a projection method to project coordinates from the earth's spherical surface onto a two dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane.
