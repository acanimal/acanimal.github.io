[Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/) has recently announced the publication of [OpenLayers Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book), my first work as a technical book author.

[OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) is one of the most complete and powerful open source JavaScript libraries for displaying map data in web browsers, providing an API for building rich web-based geographic applications similar to Google Maps and Bing Maps.

The book provides 60 practical examples to understand the main topics to create web mapping applications based on OpenLayers. It is for GIS-related professionals who have basic knowledge of web technologies, and wish to start or gain in-depth knowledge of creating web mapping applications.

The book covers the main concepts about maps, layers, controls, protocols, events, important tile providers and WMS servers and is divided in the next set of chapters:

_Chapter 1: Web Mapping Basics_  
 _Chapter 2: Adding Raster Layers_  
 _Chapter 3: Working with Vector Layers_  
 _Chapter 4: Working with Events_  
 _Chapter 5: Adding Controls_  
 _Chapter 6: Theming_  
 _Chapter 7: Styling Features_  
 _Chapter 8: Beyond the Basics_

The chapter organization tries to follow the _natural_ set of step required to learn OpenLayers from the beginning. Chapter 1 introduces the map related concepts, how it contains layers and how they can be handled. Chapters 2 and 3 shows how to work with the two kinds of layers: raster and vector. Chapters 4 and 5 describe the importance of events in web applications, the mechanism offered by OpenLayers and the main set of controls the framework implements. The chapters 6 and 7 are centered on changing the look and feel of our maps in addition to improve the look of vector features. Finally, the chapter 8 show some advanced concepts on how we can extend OpenLayers.

The process of writing a book is really complex and in addition to the author (that is me) many other people are related to it. By this reason, I would like to thank to the people at [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/openlayers-create-gis-web-applications-cookbook/book): _Usha Iyer_, _Kedar Bhat_, _Joel Goveya_, _Joyslita Dsouza_ and _Madhuri Das_ (sorry if I miss someone), to my awesome reviewers: _David Burgoon_, _Mohammad Motamedi_ (thanks Mohammad for your great review), _Jorge Sanz_, _Srinivas Shanmugam_, _Davor Zelic_ and _Richard Zijlstra_, to my own folks who always encourage me and, most important, to my wife who suffers my addiction to computer science.

Finally, thanks to all the readers of the book. I hope the book was what they expect from it.

No doubt to write here asking for help. Thanks to all !!!

### Other materials

Book is accompanied by a RIA application (implemented with the [Dojo Toolkit](http://dojotoolkit.org/)) allowing to run and show all the recipes of the book. It is freely available at my [Openlayers-Cookbook GitHub repository](https://github.com/acanimal/Openlayers-Cookbook). You can see the [application in action](http://acanimal.github.com/Openlayers-Cookbook/) online. Fell free to contribute.

Additionally, I have a presentation summarizing the main concepts of OpenLayers at the repository [OpenLayers-Presentation](https://github.com/acanimal/OpenLayers-Presentation) and can be seen also online at [OpenLayers online presentation](http://acanimal.github.com/OpenLayers-Presentation/).
